If you push your post to branch with prefix `posts/` (e.g. `posts/graphite`), your post will be rendered and displayed at https://cnblogstage.firebaseapp.com. Of course if somebody else pushes to another `post/*` branch your stuff will be overwritten. Use it to verify that your post is OK, including attachments.
