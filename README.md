# Drafts

If you push your post to branch with prefix `posts/` (e.g. `posts/graphite`), your post will be rendered and displayed at http://development.cnblogtest.divshot.io (cn/steen). Of course if somebody else pushes to another `post/*` branch your stuff will be overwritten. Use it to verify that your post is OK, including attachments.
