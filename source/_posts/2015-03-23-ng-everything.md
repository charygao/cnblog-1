There was a [screening](/2015/03/23/ng-conf-screening) of some videos from [ng-conf](http://www.ng-conf.org/) which took place about 10 days ago somewhere in US :) We have - with Mojzis - prepaired few words to kick off a discussion after the screening and I have added some extra code related to [one of those videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbcJfg-d5nI&list=PLOETEcp3DkCoNnlhE-7fovYvqwVPrRiY7&index=16).

The code was about how to count ng-related stuff visually. So if you want to see where are your `ng-clicks`, .`ng-bindings` etc you can see where they are and how many of them are there. And because my little css snippet which enable it, had quite some positive feedback I turned it (just after the screening) into a chrome extension.
